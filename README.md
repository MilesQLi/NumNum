# Deep CNN for Multi-Digit Classification

This project explores how deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to effectively identify a series of digits from real-world images that are obtained from “The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset”.  CNNs have evolved dramatically every year since the inception of the ImageNet Challenge in 2010. 

## Problem Statement
I am attempting to predict a series of numbers given an image of house numbers from the SVHN dataset. An important thing to take note is that instead of the standard identification of numbers, as with the MNIST dataset, I now need to correctly detect the numbers and the sequence of numbers. 

## Programming Language
I used Python, Keras and Tensorflow to build the model. 
- In Keras, the model uses the Functional API as it allows us to build custom and complex models.
